**🏠 Predicting Residential Property Prices Using Machine Learning**

**Project Overview:-** This project focuses on predicting residential property prices using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
It covers every step of the ML pipeline — from data exploration and preprocessing to model tuning and evaluation, helping to understand how various property attributes influence housing prices.

**Problem Statemnt:-** Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and real estate investors.
This project applies machine learning to historical housing data to estimate property values based on key factors like living area, quality, and year built.

**Key Features**

1. Complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights
2. Missing value imputation and outlier handling
3. Feature engineering (e.g., TotalSF, Age, RemodAge, Bathrooms)
4. Categorical encoding and feature scaling using ColumnTransformer
5. Model comparison: Linear Regression vs Random Forest
6. Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
7. Cross-validation for performance stability
8. Model persistence using joblib
9. Final prediction results saved as a CSV file

**Project Workflow**

1. Import necessary libraries
2. Load and clean dataset
3. Perform EDA and visualize key patterns
4. Engineer new meaningful features
5. Apply preprocessing using pipelines
6. Train models and evaluate performance
7. Optimize Random Forest with RandomizedSearchCV
8. Generate and export predictions

**💾 Artifacts**
1. house_price_best_rf.pkl → Trained Random Forest model
2. preprocessor.joblib → Saved preprocessing pipeline
3. Dataset.csv → Original dataset
4. house_price_predictions.csv → Final predicted prices

**📈 Business Insights**
1. Homes with higher quality and larger living areas are priced significantly higher.
2. Newer and recently remodeled houses tend to attract more value.
3. Machine learning models like Random Forest effectively capture complex, non-linear relationships among features.

**📊 Data Source:-** The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle’s House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition.
